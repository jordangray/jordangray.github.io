[Credit Expert][credit-expert]
------------------------------

Experian is the UK's leading credit reference agency, and Credit Expert is their flagship consumer product. It enables members of the public to explore their credit history and understand how they are seen by potential lenders.

The most complex part of the site is the credit report page, which is rendered by Angular.js. Despite its complexity, the site is fully responsive. During this project, I built a full-featured validation framework (compatible with ASP.NET MVC's unobtrusive validation attributes) from scratch, solved several critical performance issues with the new credit report and helped discover and improve a customer journey which negatively impacted dozens of potential customers daily.


ShP Portal
----------

ShP Limited is an electronics recycling company based in Lancaster, UK. Their most significant business asset is an exceptional and dedicated team of account managers, much of whose time was taken up with common account-related enquiries.

ShP Portal provides clients with on-demand access to their account history, important documents and transaction status. It also offers a dashboard with up-to-date statistics on their accounts and a new way to communicate with their account managers. Its impact was threefold:

- Account managers have more time to dedicate to more complex account issues and finding new leads.
- Existing clients get immediate access to important account information and documentation and new insight into their recycling history.
- Prospective clients are impressed by an exceptionally well-designed and comprehensive account management tool.


Whitelabel recycling services
-----------------------------

In addition to their corporate accounts team, ShP provides partners with the option of providing B2C whitelabel services to their clients. This could be done through a branded iframe embedded on the partner's website or by building a complete, whitelabeled recycling site tailored to their brand and requirements. Partners included T-Mobile, Marks & Spencer, Avios, DSGi and Trinity Mirror.

When I started at ShP, iframes took a few days to produce and were built by a third party; they can now be made live in under an hour with some basic branding information.
