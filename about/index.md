About me
========

I'm a full-stack web developer living in Nottingham, UK. I'm very experienced with CSS, JavaScript and HTML, love CoffeeScript and SASS, and previously did a lot of work with SQL Server, ASP.NET MVC and Web API, C# and F# behind the scenes.

Outside of work, I love—love!—to bake, play piano (terribly), am a voracious reader and have a strong interest in recreational mathematics, machine intelligence, physics and the future of the web.

If you want to know more about me, you can find me on [Twitter][twitter], [LinkedIn][linkedin] and [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow].
