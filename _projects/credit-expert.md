Experian is the UK's leading credit reference agency, and Credit Expert is their flagship consumer product. It enables members of the public to explore their credit history and understand how they are seen by potential lenders. Experian wanted to refresh the existing site, both to provide a better experience to their customers and to better reflect modern web development practices.

Despite the site's complexity, our team insisted on making adaptive design a cornerstone of our development, ensuring that users could access their credit history regardless of their circumstances.

The most complex part of the site is the credit report page, which downloads a JSON payload which is then rendered by Angular.js. Due to its complexity, performance was critical, and one of my roles was to find ways to improve this.

### Specific achievements

- Built a complete, flexible validation framework compatible with ASP.NET MVC's unobtrusive validation attributes.
- Developed the comprehensive help section using AJAX and the History API.
- Streamlined our production builds using Gulp and PowerShell.
- Leveraged my full-stack experience to act as a liason between our front-end and back-end teams.
- Discovered&mdash;then helped to eliminate&mdash;a significant gap in our existing sign-up journey.
