In addition to their corporate accounts team, ShP provides partners with the option of providing B2C whitelabel services to their clients. This could be done through a branded iframe embedded on the partner's website or by building a complete, whitelabeled recycling site tailored to their brand and requirements. Partners included T-Mobile, Marks & Spencer, Avios, DSGi and Trinity Mirror.

When I started at ShP, branded iframes were built by a third party and took several days to produce. They can now be made live in under an hour with some basic branding information, and require no technical expertise.

In addition, the ShP Limited retail platform provides bricks-and-mortar retailers to offer over-the-counter recycling services to their customers. At its peak, the site operated in over two hundred outlets across the UK and several more internationally, which was also whitelabeled. Notable customisations include:

- Spanish language with integrated reporting for Media Markt in Spain.
- English and Arabic internationalisation for a partner operating throughout the Middle East.
- Redesigned to integrate with touch-based POS hardware in partnership with Flex-e-card.
