UK Transport is a journey planning app that covers nearly any form of public transport, from trains and trams to ferries and buses. The developer wanted a website which would showcase the app and fit in with its pre-existing brand identity.

The existing branding was bold and energetic. This was recruited into a metaphor for empowerment. Bright, sweeping headings cut fearlessly across the page, declaring that users need &ldquo;never get lost again&rdquo;. A lone commuter, gazing at his phone, glows with assurance amidst a dim train station. Simple geometric elements invoke the language of transport maps, such as the London Tube map, conveying a sense of reassuring clarity.

Naturally the site is fully responsive, elegantly adapting to the screen sizes of UK Transport&rsquo;s target audience.
