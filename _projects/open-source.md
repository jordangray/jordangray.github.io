My most interesting project is [`WebApiContrib.Formatting.Xlsx`][github-xlsx] (formerly XLSX for Web API), a highly-configurable XSLX (Excel) MediaTypeFormatter for the ASP.NET Web API written in C#. My current—but stalled—project is a [CSS animation timeline][github-animation-timeline], which will provide a visual representation of CSS animations on a page and controls to adjust, play, rewind and skip through them.

If you want some short and sweet examples of code I've written, here's a few of my more interesting Gists:

- [StringPluralisation.cs][gist-string-pluralisation]
- [TypeUtil.js][gist-type-util]
- [jquery.shimFormAction.coffee][gist-shim-form-action]
