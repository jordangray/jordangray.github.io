ShP Limited is an electronics recycling company based in Lancaster, UK. Their most significant business asset is an exceptional and dedicated team of account managers, much of whose time was taken up with common account-related enquiries.

ShP Portal provides clients with on-demand access to their account history, important documents and transaction status. It also offers a responsive dashboard with up-to-date statistics on their accounts and allowed clients to know and communicate with their account managers.

Exceptional user experience is the key to Portal&rsquo;s success. Features were selected based on clients&rsquo; most common queries to their account managers, and the site was designed to provide obvious and immediate resolution to these user needs.

As well as adapting elegantly to mobile and tablet display sizes, the site degrades gracefully to meet the needs of our clients limited to older browsers&mdash;even those still using IE 6!&mdash;while rewarding users of modern browsers through progressive enhancement.

ShP Portal had a threefold impact:

- Account managers have more time to dedicate to more complex account issues and finding new leads.
- Existing clients get immediate access to important account information and documentation and new insight into their recycling history.
- Prospective clients are impressed by an exceptionally well-designed and comprehensive account management tool.
